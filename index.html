      <p>
      My name is Emmet Johnson, and I am a sophomore Computer Engineering student at the University of South Carolina, with a minor in Applied Mathematics. Growing up, I have always had a strong aptitude for mathematics and science, and I am especially excited by opportunities that combine computer science concepts with mathematical principles in hands-on applications. Over the years, I have developed a keen interest in computers, software, and robotics, and I am currently seeking an opportunity that will allow me to gain relevant work experience in these fields.
